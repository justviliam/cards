Hey there!

My name is Viliam, I come from Slovakia.

I can translate from English to Slovak and even Slovak to English.

My level of English should be C1: [English certificate](https://goo.gl/6TRfui) 

Some English content from myself can be found right here:  [Viliam](https://vili.am/) 

And I am a native speaker of Slovak language:  [Slovak certificate](https://goo.gl/VoSWA8)

The document above proves, that my Slovak grammar is on a decent level.

I also translated some Wordpress plugins from English to Slovak:  [Translation from English to Slovak](https://goo.gl/SwqbY9)

Am ready to work now.

Cheers

Viliam
