Hey there!

My name is Viliam, I come from Slovakia.

I can translate from English to Slovak and even Slovak to English.

My level of English is C1: [English certificate](https://goo.gl/6TRfui) 
Some English content from myself can be found right here:  [Viliam](https://vili.am/) 

And I am a native speaker of Slovak language:  [Slovak certificate](https://goo.gl/VoSWA8)
The document proves, that my grammar is on a decent level.

I translated some Wordpress plugins from English to Slovak:  [Translation from English to Slovak](https://goo.gl/SwqbY9)

Am ready to work now.

Cheers

Viliam
