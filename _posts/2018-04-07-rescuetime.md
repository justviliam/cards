We live in the greatest time in a history of human kind. And yet, we are facing fundamental problems. Nowadays, we have ton of free time. And yet, we end up spending most of it for meaningless tasks. 

But the fight hasn't been lost yet. We can manage to change our lives. And thus, we can change the world as whole.

Thing is, that the more free time we have, the less cautious we get with decision on how do we use it. 

In the past, lot of the tasks were much more complicated. Cars, electricity, internet, smartphones. None of these existed. Today, we have all of these. And they can be used for the right tasks, that's undeniable. They are simply great servants, but poor masters. 

So let's take a look how you can boost your productivity. 

## Admit, that you are spending your time on stupid shit

This part is crucial and the hardest one at the same time. You simply have to realize, that swiping Instagram feed, reading stupid stories about celebrities, refreshing your Facebook feed, watching cat videos on YouTube, checking your Email account 27 times per day... None of these are gonna help you.

All of these activities could be beneficial for you. Well, maybe except cat videos and checking your Email furiously haha. Just don't do them at excess. That's all. Thing is, that Facebook, YouTube or Instagram could be used for presenting yourself. Which might be a very valuable investment for you. 

95 % of your thoughts are unconscious. So how the hell can you fix something, if you don't even know what it is? 

First step of the process is bring awareness to the issue. **I am going to show you how to do it in 6 minutes and for free!**
