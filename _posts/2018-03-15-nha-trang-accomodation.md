I think it is better to look for accommodation before you come to Nha Trang. Here is a facebook group, where you can
find many options to choose from: https://www.facebook.com/groups/183793731994253/

## My place is about 2 km from the beach

I simply didn't want to live in tourist area for two reasons. One of them is that it is very noisy there. And second, is obviously
the higher price. And I mean way higher. 

When I get out on the street, I don't even know that I am living in 400k city. It is a very peaceful neighbourhood. And I got cool
neighbours, too. We greet each other, although I don't speak Vietnamese and they don't speak English. I can feel that they are being
genuine.

In case, I want to go to the beach (which is pretty much every day), I just go with my bike. It takes around 7 minutes. Depends on
my mood and traffic. If I feel like walking, which doesn't happen very often, it takes about 15-20 minutes. But the streets here
are not made for walking at all. You always have to step out of the pavement, because there are bikes everywhere you look.

## 300 USD for almost everything

For 300 USD, I am getting all of these facilities: internet, water, cleaning up 1x/week and place to sleep/work/eat. Then I have
to pay for electricity extra. Which is really few dollars. Last time I paid 9 USD. That is ultra cheap. So total price could be
about 310 USD. At the time of writing this article, it is an equivalent of 250 EUR. Not that bad.

I think, that you can find places even for better prices. Maybe I was too emotional, when I chose this one. And also, I didn't
bargain. Rule number one in South East Asia: always, and I mean always BARGAIN. 

## Living like a vampire

I have just too small windows and they don't bring too much light in. So I have to use extra light pretty much all day. 

This has just one advantage: I can sleep in total darkness at night.

## Facilities

Everything you need. I got bathroom, very tiny kitchen, king size bed, table for eating and working, smart TV (this one rocks) 
and if I feel like it, I can do the laundry upstairs. There are 2 washing machines for whole building. And yet, it never happened
that they would be busy. So everything's fine.

Almost I forgot about the fridge. It is a cool thing to have, too. Although, lately I have been using it just for cooling my 
water. 

When I came here, I was cooking a bit. But then I realized, it is pointless, because eating out is much better experience. And
prices are also very reasonable. I simply love Vietnamese cuisine.

## Everything you need is fairly close

Supermarket is about 1 km away. Then Vietnamese market is about 1 km away, too. And beach is about 2 km from here. The places
that I usually go to eat are either in beach area, or close to market. And it is pretty easy to get there on my hipster bike.
