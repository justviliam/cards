I read somewhere, that surfing in Vietnam is perfect for beginners, as waves are not very big here. Best time for surfing
is between september and march, at least that is what they say on the internet.

If you have never tried it, then go for it. It is a lot of fun and you will feel like a child once again. Totally clueless. But
don't worry, as my instructor said: it is easy. And I like him for this attitude. Because it is only as easy, or as hard, as you
want it to be.
