## Is your job making you happy?

If not, it is simple. Face your fear and quit. Do something else. Something that you really love. 

Life is too short to spend a big chunk of it doing what you don't like, so that you can buy things that you don't need, in order to impress the people you don't like. (someone famous once said that, don't remember who, but it is so true).

Spending 160 hours monthly doing something that is just a source of income for you is a suicide. If that is what you are doing right now, I totally feel you, because right now I am in a similar situation. And I realized that I don't wanna live like this anymore. It is time to make a shift.

## You ALWAYS have a choice

It is really easy to blame society, school system or even politicians for your current situation. And let's not forget about taxes, minorities and corruption. 

Now, try to approach this from a different point of view. What if you are fully responsible for your own life? What if you can't really blame anybody. What if you are doing a shitty job, because you chose it?

Again, I totally understand. I used to be the same. I was doing a shitty job, which I hated so much. In fact, I was doing many shitty jobs, because I didn't see the opportunities. Got lost in the darkness. And couldn't see the light all around me.

Making a shift took me a bunch of time. And when you do the shift, suddenly you realize, how hillarious was all that you came through. Because, you can look at the situation from the third person view (imagine playing World of Warcraft). 

Finally, I realized, that I was not living a happy life. Actually, I was making too many compromises to satisfy my family. Even though, I knew that it was not the best thing to do. You have to accept the fact, that you can't make everybody around you happy. It is impossibe. There is always going to be someone, who will disagree with your life choices. And that is fine. 

## Bring awareness to it

This is first step and also crucial one. You can't really solve the problem, unless you are aware of it. So, first of all, you have to realize that you don't like your job and you want to do something else. Something fullfilling. Like you always wanted to do. 

Remember when you were a kid and somebody asked you: "what you want to do, when you grow up?" I bet you do. Back in those days, we used to be so innocent and pure. We thought that world is a magical place (actually it is haha) and sky is the limit.

## Have a plan 

Unless you have reasonable amount of money saved, you have to keep doing what you are doing for some time. That is ok. 

But have a plan, what are you going to do next. Are you going to sing? make cakes? write poems? You can do whatever you like. Just think like a child. Most of the limits are created in our minds. We create them unconsciously.

My plan is to make money with this blog. And I am sure, that I can do it. I just have to put more time into it. I have been doing a lot of work back backstage, so you can't really see the changes. But it is getting big.

Or you can even create a vision and go from there. Let me give you an example: I want to make people's live better. You see, it is not said, how are you going to achieve it. And it is more abstract, which may be a better approach for some of you.

## Keep trying new things

How do you know, what is your passion, if you don't try out enough options? You should try as many things as possible. Besides, you should already have some sort of a feeling, which may guide you. For instance, if you can't count 5+5 without using a calculator, then you probably shouldn't become a coder. (I was talking about myself, my math skill sucks big time)

Sure, sometimes you will get frustrated, because it just didn't work out. But isn't it what's life about? Trial and error. Sometimes, we keep repeating the same mistakes, untill we come to a realization. I call this a beauty of life. It is an ongoing process, which will never be finished. (because I don't think, that death is a final destination)

There could be time, when you realize - god! This is what I wanna do. I love doing it. It makes me feel so alive. This is why I was born. And I am gonna do anything it takes in order to do this activity for as long as I want. That is actually how I feel right now, as I am writing down these lines.

Same story here. It took me many years to realize, that I should put more energy into writing. It makes me feel alive and energetic. And if you already found 25 errors in this article, that's good. Because it means, that I can improve a lot. And I can bring you even better value as I am doing so.

## Keep learning

The worst thing, that can happen to you is that you come to a conclusion, that - you don't need to learn anymore, because you know it all. And trust me, if the life is going your way, it will happen. Sooner or later.

It happened to me so many times. I could probably write a book on this subject. In fact, this is not about ignorance. The illusion you create is your obstacle. You may feel like you know it all. And that's the problem. In reality, you will never know it all. It is complete opposite. The more you know, the more you realize how much you don't know.

As you start doing something new, you learn pretty quickly. But as you keep doing this activity for longer period of time, you will realize, that you aren't learning as fast as before. That is the way it goes. At this point, you have two options - repeat the process with something new, or keep going.

I would suggest to keep going. Because this pattern is gonna repeat itself no matter what you do. And you suddenly realize, that you started doing and then quit too many activities, because they weren't as enjoyable as in the beginning. That happened to me in the past.

Thing is, that it is hard to realize when is it better to quit something or keep going. Intuition will tell you. Then again, it is difficult to differentiate between your ego and intuition. I guess, that it just needs some training. I am with you.
