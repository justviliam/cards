85 % of people hate their jobs, poll says

## Is your job making you happy?

If not, it is simple. Face your fear and quit. Do something else. Something that you really love. 

Life is too short to spend a big chunk of it doing what you don't like, so that you can buy things that you don't need, in order to impress the people you don't like. (someone famous once said that, don't remember who, but it is so true).

Spending 160 hours monthly doing something that is just a source of income for you is a suicide. If that is what you are doing right now, I totally feel you, because right now I am in a similar situation. And I realized that I don't wanna live like this anymore. It is time to make a shift.

## You ALWAYS have a choice

It is really easy to blame society, school system or even politicians for your current situation. And let's not forget about taxes, minorities and corruption. 

Now, try to approach this from a different point of view. What if you are fully responsible for your own life? What if you can't really blame anybody. What if you are doing a shitty job, because you chose it?

Again, I totally understand. I used to be the same. I was doing a shitty job, which I hated so much. In fact, I was doing many shitty jobs, because I didn't see the opportunities. Got lost in the darkness. And couldn't see the light all around me.

Making a shift took me a bunch of time. And when you do the shift, suddenly you realize, how hillarious was all that you came through. Because, you can look at the situation from the third person view (imagine playing World of Warcraft). 

Finally, I realized, that I was not living a happy life. Actually, I was making too many compromises to satisfy my family. Even though, I knew that it was not the best thing to do. You have to accept the fact, that you can't make everybody around you happy. It is impossibe. There is always going to be someone, who will disagree with your life choices. And that is fine. 

## Bring awareness to it

This is first step and also crucial one. You can't really solve the problem, unless you are aware of it. So, first of all, you have to realize that you don't like your job and you want to do something else. Something fullfilling. Like you always wanted to do. 

Remember when you were a kid and somebody asked you: "what you want to do, when you grow up?" I bet you do. Back in those days, we used to be so innocent and pure. We thought that world is a magical place (actually it is haha) and sky is the limit.

## Have a plan 

Unless you have reasonable amount of money saved, you have to keep doing what you are doing for some time. That is ok. 

But have a plan, what are you going to do next. Are you going to sing? make cakes? write poems? You can do whatever you like. Just think like a child. Most of the limits are created in our minds. We create them unconsciously.

My plan is to make money with this blog. And I am sure, that I can do it. I just have to put more time into it. I have been doing a lot of work back backstage, so you can't really see the changes. But it is getting big.

Or you can even create a vision and go from there. Let me give you an example: I want to make people's live better. You see, it is not said, how are you going to achieve it. And it is more abstract, which may be a better approach for some of you.

## Always keep learning
